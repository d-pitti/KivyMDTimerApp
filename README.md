# KivyMDTimerApp

Basic example of a simple timer app for Android phones. Built with Kivy / KivyMD, Python, and Buildozer for android. Nice features with Day and Night mode, Toast notification of end time, and reset. Works great on my Samsung Phone. Fun project to try out. Built in Ubuntu on windows and uploaded to mobile phone via usb.
